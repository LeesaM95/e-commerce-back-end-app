# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
The E-Commerce Application allows a user to track, update, add, and delete retail items within a sequelize application. The app uses Node, Sequelize, mysql12, and express to run. The application uses Models, Routing, and a MySql database to compile and sort data.

## Installation
This application doesn't possess a web deployment. As such, it will need to be run within node to function. Those who wish to inspect and poke through the code will have to clone the repository on to their own device. 

They'll need to made sure that they have Node installed, as well as an application like Postman or Insomnia. Users will have to pull up their terminal, and within the *main folder* of the repository, they'll have to run an '*npm install*', an '*npm run seed*', and a '*node server.js*' to get everything running. 

I personally have to open up MySql in another terminal and add the databse using the '*mysql -u root -p*' command to login, then '*CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db*' for everything to run smoothly, so that may be something that will have to be implemented as well. 

## Usage
The E-Commerce Application is a great way to keep track of retail products, departments, prices, and stocks. It also allows users to tag the products under specific sub-categories to fine tune the sorting process and give future buyers more fine-tuned search categories. 

This application uses mySql models to create tables of information under Category, Product, Tag, and ProductTag to fully sort items. 

## Support
If you find that something's not working or that the code isn't working in the way you expected, please feel free to contact me at '*leesamarie95@gmail.com*' for help or clarification. If in the event that I don't have the answers, Slack Overflow and the GitHub help forums are both wonderful resources for troubleshooting coding issues (I use them **often**).

## RoadMap
As of right now, I'm pretty content with how the application is functioning. However, if, in the event that I want to open up a small business (I have an idea in the works), I can probably tweak this code as the base to build a complete site of my own and deploy it to the web.

## Contributing
The application doesn't currently need any help, but I'm always curious to see what someone else would do in my place. If you find that you want to tinker with the code, feel free to take it and play around on another branch!

## Authors and Acknowledgement
As always, I'd like to thank all the repositories, Slack Overflow threads, and video tutorials for helping me puzzle out another nightmare for me. Regardless of the base code being done by the folks who code the assignments and challenges for the 'UCLA Full Stack Bootcamp', I'm often second guessing what I'm doing, and very much appreciate all the examples I can look at to further my own knowledge.
